        <h2>History and Background</h2>
        <p>Likhang CHAS started as a draft to solve one of the many inconveniences students from the CHAS department were experiencing- 
           its reliance on multiple, inefficient Google Forms. Recognizing this need, a group of dedicated students from level 2 took the 
           initiative to develop "Likhang CHAS," a centralized e-commerce platform. This platform aimed to streamline transactions, provide 
           a single point of access for merchandise, and simplify the buying and selling process for everyone involved. The idea was shed to 
           light by the chairman of the project and within days, it was eventually agreed upon by the whole class of 2BSN-C. Immediately, it 
           was proposed to the dean of the department, Dean Beunaseda who had a couple of suggestions. Through various revisions and the committee 
           heads and their members working together, Likhang CHAS was made and approved by the dean, faculty, and organizations they are working with.

           All that to say, Likhang CHAS is a student-led organization built to help target customers, buy and enjoy their desired merchandise to show off their school spirit! The Likhang CHAS team is an optimistic and gratitude-filled group of level 2 nursing students dedicated to creating services customers will use and love.</p>
